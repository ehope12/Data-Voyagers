# Pluto's Revenge
Connecting people and Landsat data.

## Description

Pluto's Revenge is a team at NASA's 2024 Space Apps hackathon competing in the "Landsat Reflectance Data: On the Fly and at Your Fingertips" challenge. We are creating a website to allow individuals easy access to Landsat data in order to facilitate data collection and exploration.
